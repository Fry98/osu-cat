So... how to get started? ***It's simple!*** Just download the release, unzip it and run the **EXE** file. Window of the application is fully resizeable and you can rebind your keys in the **Options** menu and switch between osu!std and Taiko in the **Mode** menu.

Props to [u/ZeCryptic](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeCryptic) for coming up with this great idea and to [u/cerealley](https://www.reddit.com/user/cerealley) for coming up with a fix for the fullscreen issue.
