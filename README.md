Introducing the latest innovation in the world of technologies: ***Bongo Cat for osu!***

So... how to get started? ***It's simple!*** Just download the release, unzip it and run the **EXE** file. Window of the application is fully resizeable and you can rebind your keys in the **Options** menu. Also, there are a pro-tip to spare you from unnecessairy headaches:

- If you're trying to record the window with **OBS / XSplit / anything else really**  and it only shows black *(or it just doesn't work somehow)*, try executing the program in compatiblity mode for **Windows 8**. That should hopefully resolve this issue.

Props to [u/ZeCryptic](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeCryptic) for coming up with this great idea and to [u/cerealley](https://www.reddit.com/user/cerealley) for coming up with a fix for the fullscreen issue.
