# Bongo Cat for **osu!**
Introducing the latest innovation in the world of technologies: ***Bongo Cat for osu!***

Live demo: https://youtu.be/upEfsKi_xdg

So... how to get started? ***It's simple!*** Just download the release, unzip it and run the **EXE** file. Window of the application is fully resizeable and you can rebind your keys in the **Options** menu. Also, there are a few pro-tips to spare you from unnecessairy headaches:

- **1)** If you're trying to record the window with **OBS / XSplit / anything else really**  and it only shows black *(or it just doesn't work somehow)*, try executing the program in compatiblity mode for **Windows 8**. That should hopefully resolve this issue.

- **2)** If the window in **OBS** gets stuck once you go into the game, try running **osu!** in a borderless window instead of fullscreen. However I was informed some poeple don't encounter this issue.

Props to [u/ZeCryptic](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeCryptic) for coming up with this great idea and to [u/cerealley](https://www.reddit.com/user/cerealley) for telling me the second issue is system specific!
